# Bigbank

I have used Cypress to Automate both frontend and API tests, below are the steps to execute the script and get the report:

Prerequisites: 
Please download and install Node.js and NPM. please refer this link for any help https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
Please download the code from github repository  https://github.com/PoojaKummur/Bigbank.git
Run below script from Bigbank folder: 
npx install
npx cypress run
The above command will execute all the Test cases and gives the report in cmd prompt itself. The test execution can also be monitored by executing the tests via Cypress runner, steps are as follows:
npx install
npx cypress open
click on Run 4 integration tests from top right to execute all the tests together
